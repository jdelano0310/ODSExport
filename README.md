# ODSExport

Super simple specific sheet to CVS file for ODS files created in Libre Office or Only Office. 
I did it just to do it after a person on Reddit asked about exporting 1 sheet from Only Office like they can do in Google Docs sheets.

There isn't much for error handling and there are no warranties while using the code. Do with it as you will.

Added the ability to select which delimiter to use when exporting the data from the ODS sheet. 
Added the publish portable files you can download from the \bin\publish folder
